# speed_typing
A Tkinter based python application that helps to improve keyboard typing speed and accuracy.

The application asks users to rewrite a random small literature paragraph and generates the below metrics:
1. Average number of inaccurate characters per word
2. Total time taken
3. Words typed per minute

The application shows also live timer to allow users to track the time spent so far.


How to run the application:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and install the requirements in requirements.txt
3. Run app.py


Future Improvements and Ideas:
1. Multiple difficulty levels to choose from
2. Session based feature that allows users to take multiple tests in a session and create a progress graph
